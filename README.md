# MyBlogProjects
This repository contains a few projects and tutorials I wrote for my blog to improve my understanding and practice delivering ML concepts lucidly. 
Due to lack of time I haven't been able to update my blog so I am uploading IPython Notebooks to share my work.

My professional and research interests include -

1. Applied Machine Learning
2. Reinforcement Learning 
3. Statistical Thinking 
4. Data Visualization
