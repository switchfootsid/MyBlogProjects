# MyBlogProjects
This repository contains a few projects and tutorials I wrote for my blog to improve my understanding and practice delivering ML concepts lucidly. Due to lack of time I haven't been able to update my blog so I am uploading IPython Notebooks to share my work.

I firmly believe that *'Data trumps human bias'.* But from my limited experience, machine learning models still require expert (human) validation and sound assumptions about data. Therefore, I really enjoy reading about how human intuition and machine learning capabilities can be integrated in solving real world problems in energy, healthcare and business.  

I also happen to be an engineer so I get to tinker with code and learn! My professional and research interests are - 

1. Applied Machine Learning
2. Reinforcement Learning 
3. Statistical Thinking & Data Visualization
4. Data Driven Product Development - A/B Testing, User Engagement etc. 
5. Scalability
